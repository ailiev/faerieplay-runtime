	* prep-circuit.cc: Using the Array class to write input values to
	arrays, so the correct structure (with branches etc) is created.
	Means some card and crypto code has to be linked in.

	* array.cc: changed the append_new_working_item() function to
	append the correct object for each T, ie. taken from that T's A.
	Seems to have fixed the problem with incorrect execution (on
	array-v1.sfdl).

	* processor.cc: for now, just has an instance of static
	initializer for a logger object.

	* processor.h: Added caching/batching of I/O operations. The
	number of operations to catch determined by the object sizes
	involved, so the cache size is fixed.

	* processor.h: Restored the use of the boost::range library, after
	figuring out that the iterator type of a range must be gotten by
	boost::range_iterator<Range>::type, and not just Range::type

	* helpers.h: Little useful functions/classes.

	* processor.h: The general stream processor, which takes an
	ordering, a "program", and IO channels, and streams the dataset
	through the program.
