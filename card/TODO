Sort out exaclty what bytes get returned when an array read index is out of
bounds, and the read result is Nothing.

Ensure that Nothing values are represented as all 0-bytes, even though only the
first byte is checked. Alternatively, just print them as all 0-bytes, so it's
the same as the value trace from Runtime.hs

Ensure that nil indices are not revealed! Ie. need to read or write *something*
even if the index is nil. Just using i=0 and ensuring that a write uses the old
value seems enough.
