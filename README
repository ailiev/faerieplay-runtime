Run as follows:
- get a gates file from the compiler, say called prog.runtime

- If needed, generate a random graph suitable for the circuit evaluator using
  RandGraph:
$ RandGraph generate 15 5 0 1024 > graph-V15-D5.txt

- start the card_server, giving it a directory to use for all the containers,
eg:
$ card_server -d containers/

- generate the circuit and value containers using prep-circuit, giving it the
dest, source and graph on stdin; call the circuit V15:
$ { echo 3; echo 7; RandGraph sfdl < graph-V15-D5.txt; } | prep-circuit -n V15 prog.runtime
  This connects to the running card_server, so the containers are wherever he
  writes them.

- encrypt the containers of V15 with enc-circuit:
$ enc-circuit -n V15

- and finally run the circuit V15:
$ runtime -n V15
