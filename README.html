<h1>Using the Circuit virtual machine</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Circuit virtual machine (CVM) can execute circuits produced by the
Faerieplay compiler. It takes a circuit and inputs for that circuit, executes
the circuit on the inputs, and prints the result.

<h2>The architecture</h2>

<p>
The CVM is intended to be run in the standard configuration for a system
utlizing a hardware TTP: a small piece (ie. which needs little RAM) in the
secure hardware, and a larger piece on the standard host machine. The secure
hardware we support is the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor (SCop). The SCop program
is called <code>cvm</code>, and the host program is called
<code>card_server</code>.
<p>
The SCop piece can be be compiled to run on the host, communicating to the
storage server over UDP. See the <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a> file for
details on how to do this.

<h2>Running</h2>

<ul>
<li>First obtain a circuit file from the compiler, eg.
<code>prog.runtime</code>.

<li>Generate inputs for the program in the C-Json format. Example C-Json files
  can be found in the <code>sfdl</code> module, eg. <code>gcd-input.cjs</code>
  and <code>insert-sort-input.cjs</code>.
   <p>
  Note that the C-Json format has some support for concatenating data files. Eg.
  The inputs for gcd could be the monolithic <code>{a=35,b=28}</code>, or the
  concatenation of <code>{a=25}</code> and <code>{b=35}</code>.

<li>Start the storage server on the host, eg<br/>
<pre>  $ card_server -d store</pre>
  to use the directory 'store' for writing the data.
  The running server can be used for many runs of the CVM.
<p>It responds to two
  signals:
  <ul><li>SIGINT: delete all the data (arrays/containers) it has written</li>
<li>SIGQUIT: exit</li>
  </ul>

<li> Run the circuit over the inputs:</br>
<pre>  $ cvm prog.runtime < inputs.cjs</pre>
  This will print the results on standard output.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logging</h2>

The CVM, as well as our other modules, use the flexible <em>log4cpp</em> logging
package. The system defines multiple <em>loggers</em> by name, typically one for
each compnent. Logging is configured dynamically using a configuration file,
along several axes:
<ul>
<li> How verbose each component's logging output is,
<li> Where logging messages are sent, eg. the console, or a file. This is handled by <em>appenders</em>.
<li> The format of the logging messages.
</ul>

We have set up the logging system to look for a configuration file called
<em>log4cpp.properties</em> in the current directory by default. The
configuration file can be explicitly specified by providing an environment
variable <em>log4cpp_config_file</em>. If no config file is found, the logging
system prints a warning, and uses a default logging level. This will probably be
too verbose for most users.
<p>
An example file <code>shared/log-quiet.properties</code> is provided which turns
off all logging except error messages, and sends log output to the console.
Another example <code>shared/log4cpp-full.properties</code> file, with extensive
commenting, is provided to show more options of log4cpp.
<p>
The names of the loggers currently in the system can be obtained with the
<code>get-logger-names.sh</code> script, run from the root code directory.
Currently they are:
