An important note about conditionals in circuits: all the operatins are done
even of the condition fails! condition only ensures that the intended values are
used afterwards. so, one cannot guard eg. zero division in the SFDL
program, the runtime must be able to handle it, probably produce an incorrect
result, and hope that the SFDL program will ignore it through its conditionals.

Implementation of "Maybe" values throughout the runtime:
- represent all Maybe values as 1 byte indicating if there is a value, and 4
  bytes (always?) with the actual value.
- can automate this around the basic2bb etc routines in ByteBuffer.

dealing with array inputs:

- prep-circuit creates the circuit, using the name given by the gate's comment,
  but does not put a value into the gate's value slot.

- runtime, when it reaches that Input gate, opens the Array container using the
  gate's comment, and puts in its own opaque ID for the array in the gate's
  value slot.

How to examine the container files generated by test-batcher-permute, with
encryption turned off:
$ ls -d * | filter '[ ! -d {} ]' | sort -n | \
  while read f; do echo -n $f: ; od -A n -i $f; done

runtime on the 589 gates it managed to do before dying:
