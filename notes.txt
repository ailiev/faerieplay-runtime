An important note about conditionals in circuits: all the operatins are done
even of the condition fails! condition only ensures that the intended values are
used afterwards. so, one cannot guard eg. zero division in the SFDL
program, the runtime must be able to handle it, probably produce an incorrect
result, and hope that the SFDL program will ignore it through its conditionals.
